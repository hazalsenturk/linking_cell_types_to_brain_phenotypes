## Summary 
This repository presents a comprehensive data-driven approach to unraveling the cellular and molecular underpinnings of psychiatric disorders, with a focus on schizophrenia. By integrating single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) results, our work identifies and characterizes specific brain cell types implicated in disease etiology. Our findings not only validate previously reported associations but also reveal novel cell type contributions, achieving greater molecular specificity than earlier studies. This project further lays the foundation for a cell-type based classification system and offers a strategic roadmap for drug repurposing, novel therapeutic development, and personalized treatment strategies for psychiatric and other complex brain disorders.

> [!WARNING]
> In our analysis, the term "cluster" as used in the Siletti 2023 paper is referred to as "cell types". Please keep this terminology difference in mind when interpreting the results and comparing findings with the original publication.

## Environment Setup
Before running the analysis, please ensure that you have the following software and libraries installed.
1. Python libraries: `h5py`, `numexpr`
2. R libraries: `tidyverse`, `rhdf5`, `AnnotationDbi`, `org.Hs.eg.db`, `dplyr`, `readr` 
3. [MAGMA v1.10](https://cncr.nl/research/magma/)

## Data Requirements
1. GWAS summary statistics
   - The schizophrenia summary statistics used in the example code can be downloaded from the [PGC website](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/scz2022/19426775)
   - File name: `PGC3_SCZ_wave3.european.autosome.public.v3.vcf.tsv`
   - File md5sum = `2955c20b93f62607d650c83e7c41b0c7`
2. [Siletti et al.'s single-cell RNAseq dataset](https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain)
3. [MAGMA auxiliary files](https://cncr.nl/research/magma/) of the same genome build and ancestry as GWAS summary statistics to be used
    - The schizophrenia summary statistics used in the example code are build 37 and only include individuals of European ancestry
    - [Gene locations, build 37 file](https://vu.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/s/Pj2orwuF2JYyKxq): `NCBI37.3.gene.loc`, md5sum = `7f6ffd6abb0b02c94a629e74c036d5f6`
    - [European ancestry reference data](https://vu.data.surfsara.nl/index.php/s/VZNByNwpD8qqINe): download the folder `g1000_eur`, which contains
      - `g1000_eur.bed`, md5sum = `543f92fba6ffe987dabf848b169c968d`
      - `g1000_eur.bim`, md5sum = `48fbc06e2ec736fbcc58989cb1727322`
      - `g1000_eur.fam`, md5sum = `6935b96c7e6f2a8f6122a049969bd0b8`
      - `g1000_eur.synonyms`, md5sum = `2807fd31bf0e92685c63629dc49b6574`
    - Put these 5 files in a directory called `aux` to use when running MAGMA
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure Data Compatibility. Please confirm the following items:
> 1. The summary statistics are from a single population that matches MAGMA's auxiliary data.
> 2. The summary statistics are the same genome build as MAGMA's auxiliary files.
> 3. If the summary statistics do not contain a SNP ID column, obtain the SNP IDs from the chromosomal and base pair positions using a reference file of the same genome build.

## Get MAGMA Inputs
Follow the following steps:
1. [Get the ln(1+x)-transformed cluster-by-gene matrix.](Preprocessing_Siletti/create_matrices/Siletti_create_L2-log_dataset.py)
2. [Preprocess the matrix and calculate specificity.](Preprocessing_Siletti/create_magma_inputs/get_Siletti_continuous_input.md)

## Run MAGMA

Then, follow the steps below to run MAGMA (scripts to be modified accordingly):
1. Create a SNP location file (`snploc_{GWAS_file_name}`) that contains three columns of the GWAS summary statistics in the following order: SNP ID, chromosome, and base pair position.
2. Annotate and conduct a gene analysis.
     Example code is provided [here](MAGMA/1.annotationAndGeneAnalysis.sh). The annotation step requires SNP location files created earlier, while the gene analysis step requires original GWAS files. Please refer to the MAGMA manual for different specification options for sample size and more.
4. Run a gene property analysis.
     Example code is provided [here](MAGMA/2.genePropertyAnalysis.sh). Please also refer to the MAGMA manual for the usage of different flag options.

### Conditional Analysis
To run a pairwise conditional analysis on clusters after the steps above, follow these steps (scripts to be modified accordingly):
1. To limit the computation time, [create a MAGMA input file with only top clusters](MAGMA/3.create_top_results_matrix.md), as indicated by the results from the previous step.
2. [Run a pairwise conditional analysis.](MAGMA/4.conditionalAnalysis.sh)
3. [Conduct a forward stepwise selection](MAGMA/5.forward_selection_condition_results.md) to arrive at a list of independent clusters.
